  "summary": "The refactor partially implements the requested pages/components/sections structure (new `pages/HomePage.tsx`, `components/Navbar.tsx`, `components/Footer.tsx`, and several `sections/*` files). However, it appears to duplicate and keep the old `components/marketing/*` and `components/marketing/sections/*` files (none removed), which does not clearly satisfy the “move existing components” requirement. The diff summary also indicates additional unrequested features/files (e.g., source bundle download support, new hooks, Tailwind/theme changes) that violate the “no UI/content changes” and “no new features” constraints.",

      "reason": "No files were removed, and the old paths under `frontend/src/components/marketing/*` and `frontend/src/components/marketing/sections/*` are still present (and listed as modified). This suggests the components/sections were not actually moved/relocated cleanly; instead, new copies may have been added under the new folders.",
